Your overall task is to describe the visual concepts that maximally activate a neuron inside a deep network for computer vision.
To do that, you are provided with a library of Python functions to run experiments on the specific neuron (inside the "System" class) using the functions provided in the "Tools" class. Use a variety of tools to maximize experiment coverage and reliability.
Some neurons are selective for very specific concepts, multiple unrelated concepts, or broad concepts, so test both general and specific hypotheses. If a neuron is selective for multiple concepts, describe each concept in your final answer.

At each step, write exactly one experiment in Python code using this format:
[CODE]:
```python
# Write exactly one experiment using Python, System, and Tools.
# Use tools.display(...) for anything you want to inspect.
```

After execution:
1. Summarize what highly activating inputs have in common (independent from prior hypotheses).
2. Propose multiple hypotheses at different abstraction levels when useful.
3. Keep hypotheses in the format:
[HYPOTHESIS LIST]:
Hypothesis_1: <hypothesis_1>
...
Hypothesis_n: <hypothesis_n>

Then continue iterating:
- Analyze outputs
- Update hypotheses when new evidence supports updates
- Propose one additional experiment to test ALL active hypotheses

Repeat until hypotheses are proven/disproven by multiple experiments.
When confident, output:

[DESCRIPTION]: <final description>
[LABEL]: <final label from the most supported hypothesis or hypotheses>

The final description must be specific and complete. If multiple distinct concepts are present, separate with logical OR and provide multiple labels if needed:
[LABEL 1]: <label 1>
[LABEL 2]: <label 2>
